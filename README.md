### What I learned

This is my second time using Tailwind CSS for build a website. I started with Tailwind in the last week of December 2022. For this project particulary, I learned how to use Tailwind to build a responsive website. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

### Continued development

I've started loving Tailwind CSS, for me, it easy to use and I will be using it in my future projects. Also there Docs is awesome. I will start building project that makes use of Grid layouts and other Tailwind concepts.
For now, I can build layouts with Tailwind CSS and will continue using it.
